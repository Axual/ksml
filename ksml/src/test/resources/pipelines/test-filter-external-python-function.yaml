# This example shows how to filter messages from a simple stream. Here we only let "blue sensors" pass and discard
# other messages after logging.

streams:
  sensor_source:
    topic: ksml_sensordata_avro
    keyType: string
    valueType: avro:SensorData
  sensor_filtered:
    topic: ksml_sensordata_filtered
    keyType: string
    valueType: avro:SensorData

functions:
  sensor_is_blue:
    type: predicate
    code: file:test-filter-external-python-function.py
    expression: values_is_blue(key, value)

pipelines:
  filter_pipeline:
    from: sensor_source
    via:
      - type: filter
        if: sensor_is_blue
      - type: peek
        forEach:
          code: log.info("MESSAGE ACCEPTED - key={}, value={}", key, value)
    to: sensor_filtered
