# Function Reference

This document provides a comprehensive reference for all function types available in KSML. Functions in KSML allow you to implement custom logic for processing your streaming data using Python, making stream processing accessible to data scientists, analysts, and developers who may not be familiar with Java or Kafka Streams API.

## What are Functions in KSML?

Functions provide the flexibility to go beyond built-in operations and implement specific business logic, transformations, and data processing requirements. They are written in Python and executed within the KSML runtime, combining the power of Kafka Streams with the simplicity and expressiveness of Python.

## Writing Python Functions

### Example KSML Function Definition
??? info "Example KSML Function Definition"

      ```yaml
      functions:
        # Example of a complete function definition with all components
        process_sensor_data:
          type: valueTransformer
          globalCode: |
            # This code runs once when the application starts
            import json
            import time
            
            # Initialize global variables
            sensor_threshold = 25.0
            alert_count = 0
            
          code: |
            # This code runs for each message
            global alert_count
            
            # Process the sensor value
            if value is None:
              return None
              
            temperature = value.get("temperature", 0)
            
            # Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
            temperature_f = (temperature * 9/5) + 32
            
            # Check for alerts
            is_alert = temperature > sensor_threshold
            if is_alert:
              alert_count += 1
              log.warn("High temperature detected: {}Â°C", temperature)
            
            # Return enriched data
            result = {
              "original_temp_c": temperature,
              "temp_fahrenheit": temperature_f,
              "is_alert": is_alert,
              "total_alerts": alert_count,
              "processed_at": int(time.time() * 1000)
            }
            
            return result
            
          resultType: json
          
        # Example of a simple expression-based function
        is_high_priority:
          type: predicate
          expression: value.get("priority", 0) > 7
          resultType: boolean
      ```

KSML functions are defined in the `functions` section of your KSML definition file. A typical function definition includes:

- **Type**: Specifies the function's purpose and behavior
- **Parameters**: Input parameters the function accepts (defined by the function type)
- **GlobalCode**: Python code executed only once upon application start
- **Code**: Python code implementing the function's logic
- **Expression**: Shorthand for simple return expressions
- **ResultType**: The expected return type of the function

## Function Definition Formats

KSML supports two formats for defining functions:

### Expression Format

For simple, one-line functions:

```yaml
functions:
  is_valid:
    type: predicate
    code: |
      # Code is optional here
    expression: value.get("status") == "ACTIVE"
```

### Code Block Format

For more complex functions:

```yaml
functions:
  process_transaction:
    type: keyValueMapper
    code: |
      result = {}

      # Copy basic fields
      result["transaction_id"] = value.get("id")
      result["amount"] = value.get("amount", 0)

      # Calculate fee
      amount = value.get("amount", 0)
      if amount > 1000:
        result["fee"] = amount * 0.02
      else:
        result["fee"] = amount * 0.03

      # Add timestamp
      result["processed_at"] = int(time.time() * 1000)

      return result
    resultType: struct
```


## Function Execution Context

When your Python functions execute, they have access to:

- **Logger**: For outputting information to application logs
      - `log.<log-level>("Debug message")` - <log_level> can be debug, info, warn, error, trace

- **Metrics**: For monitoring function performance and behavior
      - `metrics.counter("name").increment()` - Count occurrences
      - `metrics.gauge("name").record(value)` - Record values
      - `with metrics.timer("name"):` - Measure execution time

- **State Stores**: For maintaining state between function invocations (when configured)
      - `store.get(key)` - Retrieve value from store
      - `store.put(key, value)` - Store a value
      - `store.delete(key)` - Remove a value
      - Must be declared in the function's `stores` parameter

This execution context provides the tools needed for debugging, monitoring, and implementing stateful processing.

## Function Types Overview

KSML supports 21 function types, each designed for specific purposes in stream processing. Functions can range from simple one-liners to complex implementations with multiple operations:

- [Example for `initializer`](../tutorials/intermediate/aggregations.md#complex-example-regional-sales-analytics)

### merger

Merges two aggregation results into one. Used in aggregation operations to combine partial results.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description                           |
|-----------|------|---------------------------------------|
| key       | Any  | The key of the record being processed |
| value1    | Any  | The value of the first aggregation    |
| value2    | Any  | The value of the second aggregation   |

#### Return Value

The merged aggregation result

#### Example

??? info "Producer - Session Activity Events (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/merger-example-producer.yaml" %}
    ```

??? info "Processor - Session Window with Merger (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/merger-example-processor.yaml" %}
    ```


The merger function is specifically designed for session window aggregations where late-arriving events can merge previously separate sessions. This example demonstrates user activity tracking with session-based counting.

**What the example does:**

Simulates user activity tracking with session windows and merging:

* Groups events into 10-min inactivity sessions
* Counts events per user
* Merges sessions when late events connect them
* Producer simulates gaps to trigger merging

**Key Features:**

* Automatic session windowing & late data handling
* Type-safe merger (integers)
* Windowed key transformation for output
* Merge logic adds event counts

**Expected Results:**

When running this example, you'll see log messages like:

- `"Merging sessions: 3 + 2 = 5"` - Shows the merger function combining session counts
- `"User alice session: 4 events"` - Displays final session results after merging
- Session windows spanning different time periods for each user

### reducer

Combines two values into one.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description                 |
|-----------|------|-----------------------------|
| value1    | Any  | The first value to combine  |
| value2    | Any  | The second value to combine |

#### Return Value

Combined value

**See how `reducer` is used in an example definition**:

- [Example for `reducer` function](../tutorials/intermediate/aggregations.md#human-readable-reduce-json-format)

| Parameter | Type | Description                               |
|-----------|------|-------------------------------------------|
| value     | Any  | The value of the record to get a key from |

#### Return Value

The key to look up in the table being joined with

#### Example

??? info "Producer - Orders and Customers (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/foreignkeyextractor-producer.yaml" %}
    ```

??? info "Processor - Table Join with ForeignKeyExtractor (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/foreignkeyextractor-processor.yaml" %}
    ```

The foreignKeyExtractor enables table joins where the join key is embedded within the record value rather than being the record key. This example demonstrates order enrichment by joining with customer data using a foreign key relationship.

**Example**

This example simulates an e-commerce system enriching orders with customer data:

* Orders keyed by `order_id`, referencing `customer_id`
* Customer details looked up by `customer_id`
* Foreign key extracted from orders
* Orders joined with customers to produce enriched records

**Key Features:**

* Foreign key join pattern
* KSML table join with key extraction
* Data enrichment from multiple sources
* Preserves original order keys

**Expected Results:**

When running this example, you'll see log messages like:

- `"Joined order order_001 with customer Alice Johnson"` - Shows successful order-customer joins
- `"Enriched order: order_003 for customer: Bob Smith"` - Displays enriched results with customer names
- Orders enriched with customer tier, email, and name information

**Use Cases:**

This pattern is commonly used for:

- Order enrichment with customer details
- Transaction enrichment with account information  
- Event enrichment with user profiles
- Any scenario where records contain foreign key references

    ```

**This example:**

- Shows metadata enrichment in stream processing.
* Generates realistic API events (endpoints + status codes)
* Enriches headers with timestamps, severity, processor ID
* Classifies events (critical/warning/info) by status code
* Logs enrichment for monitoring/debugging
* Uses Python `time` for timestamps

* Creates events with custom timestamps that simulate out-of-order and delayed processing scenarios
* Extracts event-time timestamps from message content rather than using record timestamps
* Processes events based on their event time rather than arrival time
* Provides robust fallback mechanisms for missing or invalid timestamps
* Uses custom `timestampExtractor` function in stream definition
* Uses Python time manipulation and timestamp handling
* Support for both ConsumerRecord and direct value access patterns

**Expected Results:**

When running this example, you'll see events processed in time order:

- `Event processed in time order: event_0001 (event_time=1755974335641, delay=155s)`
- `Event processed in time order: event_0002 (event_time=1755974539885, delay=41s)`  
- Log messages showing: "Using event timestamp: 1755974601885 for event_0015"

### topicNameExtractor

    ```

??? info "Processor - Dynamic Topic Routing (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/topicnameextractor-processor.yaml" %}
    ```

**What the example does:**

Demonstrates dynamic topic routing based on message content:

* Creates mixed sensor data (temperature, humidity, pressure) with varying alert levels
* Routes messages to different topics based on sensor type and priority
* Prioritizes critical alerts to a dedicated topic regardless of sensor type
* Distributes normal/warning messages to type-specific topics

**Key Technical Features:**

* `topicNameExtractor` function for dynamic topic selection
* Priority-based routing with alert level evaluation
* Fallback topic handling for unknown sensor types
* `toTopicNameExtractor` operation instead of static `to` operation
* Integration with logging for routing visibility

**Expected Results:**

When running this example, you'll see messages routed to different topics:

- Critical alerts: `"Critical alert from sensor sensor_05: pressure reading = 78.26"` â `critical_sensor_alerts` topic
- Normal temperature readings â `temperature_sensors` topic
- Normal humidity readings â `humidity_sensors` topic
- Normal pressure readings â `pressure_sensors` topic
- Unknown sensor types â `unknown_sensor_data` topic

## Other Functions

### generic

Generic custom function that can be used for any purpose. It can accept custom parameters and return any type of value.

#### Parameters

User-defined parameters

#### Return Value

Any value, depending on the function's purpose

#### Example

??? info "Producer - Product Data Generation (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/generic-producer.yaml" %}
    ```

??? info "Processor - Price Calculation with Generic Function (click to expand)"

    ```yaml
    {% include "../definitions/reference/functions/generic-processor.yaml" %}
    ```

**What the example does:**

Demonstrates how to create reusable business logic with generic functions:

* Creates sample product data with base prices and discount rates
* `calculate_price` accepts parameters to compute final pricing with tax
* The generic function is called from within a valueTransformer
* Adds calculated pricing information to product records

**Key Technical Features:**

* `type: generic` for reusable custom functions
* Custom parameter definitions with types (double, string, etc.)
* Return any data structure (JSON objects, arrays, primitives)
* Call generic functions from other functions using standard Python syntax
* Mix generic functions with standard KSML function types

**Expected Results:**

When running these examples, you will see:

- Product data being generated with random base prices and discount rates
- Log messages showing: "Processed product: prod_001 - Original: $856.58, Final: $922.50, Saved: $128.49" 
- Each product enriched with detailed pricing calculations including tax
- Generic function providing consistent pricing logic across all products

## Best Practices

1. **Keep functions focused**: Each function should do one thing well
2. **Handle errors gracefully**: Use try/except blocks to prevent pipeline failures
3. **Consider performance**: Python functions introduce some overhead, so keep them efficient
4. **Use appropriate function types**: Choose the right function type for your use case
5. **Leverage state stores**: For complex stateful operations, use state stores rather than global variables
6. **Document your functions**: Add comments to explain complex logic and business rules
7. **Test thoroughly**: Write unit tests for your functions to ensure they behave as expected
