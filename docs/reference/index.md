# Reference Documentation

Welcome to the KSML Reference Documentation! This section provides comprehensive technical details about all aspects of KSML. It serves as a complete reference for KSML syntax, operations, functions, data types, and configuration options.

While the [tutorials](../tutorials/beginner/index.md) and [core concepts](../core-concepts/index.md) sections focus on learning and understanding, this reference section is designed for looking up specific details when you need them.
