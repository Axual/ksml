# Use Case Guides

Welcome to the KSML Use Case Guides! These guides demonstrate how to apply KSML to solve real-world business problems and implement common stream processing patterns.

Unlike the tutorials that focus on specific KSML features, these guides take a problem-first approach, showing you how to combine various KSML capabilities to address practical use cases.

## Available Use Case Guides

### [Data Transformation](data-transformation.md)

This guide covers common data transformation patterns:

- Format conversion (JSON to Avro, CSV to JSON, etc.)
- Data normalization and cleansing
- Schema evolution handling
- Complex data transformations

### [Event-Driven Applications](event-driven-applications.md)

Learn how to build event-driven applications with KSML:

- Implementing the event sourcing pattern
- Building event-driven microservices
- Command-query responsibility segregation (CQRS)
- Event notification systems


### [IoT Data Processing](iot-data-processing.md)

Learn how to process IoT data streams with KSML:

- Handling high-volume sensor data
- Device state tracking
- Geospatial data processing
- Edge-to-cloud data pipelines

### [Real-time Analytics](real-time-analytics.md)

Learn how to implement real-time analytics solutions with KSML:

- Building real-time dashboards
- Calculating key performance indicators
- Implementing sliding window analytics
- Detecting anomalies in streaming data

### [Fraud Detection](fraud-detection.md)

This guide demonstrates how to implement fraud detection systems:

- Pattern recognition in transaction streams
- Real-time risk scoring
- Multi-factor anomaly detection
- Alert generation and notification

## How to Use These Guides

Each guide includes:

1. **Problem Statement**: A clear description of the business problem or use case
2. **Solution Architecture**: An overview of the KSML solution design
3. **Implementation**: Step-by-step instructions with KSML code examples
4. **Testing and Validation**: How to test and validate the solution
5. **Production Considerations**: Tips for deploying to production environments

You can follow these guides end-to-end to implement the complete solution, or adapt specific patterns to your own use cases.
