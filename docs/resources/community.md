## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Is KSML open source?**  
A: Yes, KSML is open source under the Apache 2.0 license.

**Q: How does KSML compare to writing Kafka Streams applications in Java?**  
A: KSML provides a higher-level abstraction that makes it easier to define stream processing applications without writing Java code. It's particularly beneficial for data engineers and analysts who may not be Java experts.

**Q: Can I use KSML in production?**  
A: Yes, KSML is production-ready and used by many organizations in production environments.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I extend KSML with custom operations?**  
A: Yes, you can create custom operations in Java and use them in your KSML definitions.

**Q: How does KSML handle schema evolution?**  
A: KSML supports schema evolution through its integration with schema registries and flexible data handling.

**Q: What's the performance impact of using KSML vs. native Kafka Streams?**  
A: KSML compiles down to native Kafka Streams code, so the runtime performance is comparable to hand-written Kafka Streams applications.

## Conclusion

The KSML community is here to help you succeed with your stream processing projects. Whether you're just getting started or you're an experienced user, we encourage you to participate, ask questions, and share your knowledge.
