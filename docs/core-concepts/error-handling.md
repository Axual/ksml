# Error Handling

Learn about error handling strategies and techniques in KSML to build robust, resilient stream processing applications.

## What is Error Handling in KSML?

Error handling in KSML refers to the strategies and mechanisms used to detect, manage, and recover from errors that occur during stream processing. Effective error handling is crucial for building reliable applications that can continue operating even when unexpected conditions arise.

In stream processing applications, errors can occur at various levels: during data deserialization, within processing logic, when interacting with external systems, or due to resource constraints. KSML provides several approaches to handle these errors gracefully.

## Types of Errors in Stream Processing

### Deserialization Errors

These occur when incoming data cannot be properly parsed according to the expected schema:

- **Schema Mismatch**: Incoming data doesn't match the expected schema
- **Invalid Format**: Data is corrupted or in an unexpected format
- **Version Conflicts**: Schema version incompatibilities

### Processing Errors

These occur during the execution of stream processing logic:

- **Function Exceptions**: Errors thrown by user-defined functions
- **Null Pointer Exceptions**: Attempting to access null values
- **Type Conversion Errors**: Failed attempts to convert between data types
- **Arithmetic Errors**: Division by zero, overflow, etc.

### External System Errors

These occur when interacting with external systems:

- **Connection Failures**: Unable to connect to databases, APIs, etc.
- **Timeout Errors**: An external system doesn't respond in time
- **Authentication Errors**: Failed authentication with external systems
- **Resource Unavailability**: External resources temporarily unavailable

### Resource Constraint Errors

These occur due to limitations in the processing environment:

- **Memory Limitations**: Out of memory errors
- **CPU Constraints**: Processing cannot keep up with incoming data
- **Disk Space Issues**: Insufficient storage for state or logs
- **Network Bandwidth Limitations**: Network cannot handle data volume

## Types of Errors in Producing

### Serialization Errors

These occur when outgoing data cannot be properly encoded according to the expected schema:

- **Schema Mismatch**: Outgoing data doesn't match the expected schema
- **Invalid Format**: Data is incomplete or in an unexpected format
- **Version Conflicts**: Schema version incompatibilities

## Error Handling Strategies

### Dead Letter Queues (DLQs)

Sending problematic records to a separate topic for later processing:

```yaml
{% include "../definitions/error-handling/dead-letter-queue.yaml" %}
```

### Retry Mechanisms

Attempting to process failed records multiple times:

```yaml
pipelines:
  send_notifications:
    from: notification_requests
    mapValues:
      function: send_notification
      retry:
        maxAttempts: 3
        backoffMs: 1000
        multiplier: 2
    to: notification_results
```

### Error Transformation

Converting errors into valid records that can continue through the pipeline:

```yaml
pipelines:
  validate_orders:
    from: incoming_orders
    mapValues:
      function: validate_order
      onError:
        transform: create_error_response
    to: validated_orders
```

### Circuit Breakers

Preventing cascading failures when external systems are unavailable:

```yaml
pipelines:
  process_payments:
    from: payment_requests
    mapValues:
      function: process_payment
      circuitBreaker:
        failureThreshold: 5
        resetTimeoutMs: 30000
    to: payment_results
```

## Implementing Error Handling

### Basic Error Handling

At the most basic level, you can handle errors within your functions:

```python
# In a real implementation, you would define or import necessary functions
def process_data(value):
    try:
        # Process the data
        # perform_processing would be your actual data processing function
        result = perform_processing(value)
        return result
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the error
        # log_error would be your logging function
        log_error(f"Error processing data: {e}")
        return {"status": "error", "message": str(e)}
```

### Pipeline-Level Error Handling

KSML allows you to configure error handling at the pipeline level:

```yaml
pipelines:
  data_processing:
    configuration:
      default.deserialization.exception.handler: log_and_continue
      default.production.exception.handler: log_and_continue
    from: input_topic
    mapValues: process_data
    to: output_topic
```

### Operation-Level Error Handling

You can also configure error handling for specific operations:

```yaml
pipelines:
  enrich_data:
    from: raw_data
    mapValues:
      function: enrich_with_external_data
      onError:
        action: skip
        log: true
    to: enriched_data
```

## Advanced Error Handling Techniques

### Compensating Transactions

Implementing operations that can undo previous actions when errors occur:

```yaml
pipelines:
  order_processing:
    from: orders
    mapValues:
      function: process_order
      onError:
        compensate: reverse_order_processing
    to: processed_orders
```

### Saga Pattern

Managing distributed transactions across multiple services:

```yaml
pipelines:
  order_saga:
    from: order_commands
    mapValues: start_order_saga
    to: order_events
    
  payment_saga:
    from: order_events
    filter: is_payment_required
    mapValues:
      function: process_payment
      onError:
        compensate: refund_payment
    to: payment_events
    
  shipping_saga:
    from: payment_events
    filter: is_payment_successful
    mapValues:
      function: arrange_shipping
      onError:
        compensate: cancel_shipping
    to: shipping_events
```

### Error Recovery Workflows

Creating dedicated pipelines for handling and recovering from errors:

```yaml
pipelines:
  main_processing:
    from: input_data
    mapValues: process_data
    to: processed_data
    
  error_recovery:
    from: error_queue
    mapValues: analyze_and_recover
    branch:
      - predicate: can_retry
        mapValues: prepare_for_retry
        to: input_data
      - predicate: needs_manual_review
        to: manual_review_queue
      - to: permanent_failures
```

## Monitoring and Observability

Effective error handling requires comprehensive monitoring:

- **Error Metrics**: Track error rates, types, and sources
- **Dead Letter Queue Monitoring**: Monitor size and processing of DLQs
- **Retry Metrics**: Track retry attempts and success rates
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: Monitor the state of circuit breakers
- **Alerting**: Set up alerts for critical error conditions

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

- **Fail Fast**: Detect and respond to errors quickly
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue providing service, possibly with reduced functionality
- **Isolation**: Prevent errors in one component from affecting others
- **Transparency**: Make errors visible and traceable
- **Recovery**: Design systems to recover automatically when possible

### Implementation Guidelines

- **Categorize Errors**: Different error types require different handling strategies
- **Log Comprehensively**: Include context, not just error messages
- **Test Error Scenarios**: Explicitly test how your system handles errors
- **Consider Downstream Impact**: Understand how errors affect downstream systems
- **Balance Retry vs. Discard**: Not all errors should be retried
