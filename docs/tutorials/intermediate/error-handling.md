# Error Handling and Recovery in KSML

This tutorial explores strategies for handling errors and implementing recovery mechanisms in KSML applications, helping you build more robust and resilient stream processing pipelines.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial:

- Have [Docker Compose KSML environment setup running](../../getting-started/basics-tutorial.md#choose-your-setup-method)

## Introduction to Error Handling

Error handling is a critical aspect of any production-grade stream processing application. In streaming contexts, errors can occur for various reasons:

- **Data Quality Issues**: Invalid, malformed, or missing data
- **External Service Failures**: Network timeouts, API errors, service unavailability
- **Resource Constraints**: Memory limitations, disk space issues
- **Business Rule Violations**: Data that doesn't meet application requirements
- **Unexpected Edge Cases**: Scenarios not covered in the original design

Without proper error handling, these issues can cause your application to crash, lose important messages, produce incorrect results, or create inconsistent state.

## Core Error Handling Strategies

KSML provides several mechanisms to handle errors gracefully and implement recovery strategies, allowing your applications to continue processing even when problems occur.

### 1. Validation and Filtering

Proactively validate data and filter out problematic messages before they cause errors downstream.

??? info "Order Events Producer (for testing) - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/producer-order-events.yaml"
    %}
    ```

??? info "Validation and Filtering Processor - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/processor-validation-filtering.yaml"
    %}
    ```

This example demonstrates:

- **Early validation**: Check required fields and data ranges before processing
- **Route separation**: Valid orders go to one topic, invalid to another
- **Detailed error information**: Add validation status and specific issues to messages
- **Comprehensive logging**: Track what's happening with each message for debugging

Key benefits:

- Prevents downstream errors by catching issues early
- Provides detailed information about data quality problems
- Allows different handling strategies for different error types
- Maintains processing flow even with bad data

### 2. Try-Catch Error Handling

Use try-catch blocks in Python functions to handle errors gracefully and provide fallback values.

??? info "Sensor Data Producer (with error conditions) - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/producer-sensor-data.yaml"
    %}
    ```

??? info "Try-Catch Error Handling Processor - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/processor-try-catch.yaml"
    %}
    ```

This example demonstrates:

- **Graceful error handling**: Use try-catch to prevent function failures
- **Error classification**: Distinguish between validation errors and processing errors
- **Fallback strategies**: Return error information when processing fails
- **Contextual logging**: Log different levels based on error severity

Key patterns:

- Always handle None/null values explicitly
- Differentiate between expected errors (validation) and unexpected errors
- Provide meaningful error messages with context
- Use appropriate log levels (warn for expected issues, error for unexpected)

### 3. Dead Letter Queue Pattern

Implement dead letter queues to capture messages that can't be processed, with retry logic for transient failures.

??? info "Order Events Producer (same as above) - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/producer-order-events.yaml"
    %}
    ```

??? info "Dead Letter Queue Processor - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/processor-dead-letter-queue.yaml"
    %}
    ```

This example demonstrates:

- **Error classification**: Permanent errors vs. temporary errors that can be retried  
- **Retry logic**: Attempt processing multiple times for transient failures
- **Dead letter routing**: Send failed messages to dedicated error topics
- **Rich error context**: Include original data, error details, and retry counts

Key concepts:

- **Permanent errors** (validation failures): Go directly to dead letter queue
- **Temporary errors** (service timeouts): Can be retried with exponential backoff
- **Retry limits**: Prevent infinite retry loops by setting maximum retry counts
- **Error enrichment**: Add timestamps, retry counts, and error classifications

## Advanced Error Handling Patterns

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures when external services are unavailable.

??? info "API Requests Producer (with various service conditions) - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/producer-api-requests.yaml"
    %}
    ```

??? info "Circuit Breaker Processor - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/processor-circuit-breaker.yaml"
    %}
    ```

This example demonstrates:

- **Circuit breaker states**: CLOSED (normal), OPEN (failing), HALF_OPEN (testing recovery)
- **Failure threshold**: Opens circuit after consecutive failures
- **Automatic recovery**: Transitions to HALF_OPEN after timeout period
- **State management**: Tracks failure counts and success rates
- **Fast failure**: Rejects requests immediately when circuit is open

Key benefits:

- Prevents resource exhaustion from repeated failures
- Allows services to recover without being overwhelmed
- Provides clear visibility into service health
- Reduces latency by failing fast when services are down

### 5. Compensating Transactions

For complex business operations that span multiple systems, implement compensating actions to maintain consistency.

??? info "Business Transactions Producer - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/producer-transactions.yaml"
    %}
    ```

??? info "Compensating Transactions Processor - click to expand"

    ```yaml
    {%
      include "../../definitions/intermediate-tutorial/error-handling/processor-compensating-transactions.yaml"
    %}
    ```

This example demonstrates:

- **Multi-step transactions**: Order fulfillment with inventory, payment, and shipping
- **Compensation logic**: Automatically undo completed steps when failures occur
- **Rollback order**: Compensate operations in reverse order of execution
- **Detailed tracking**: Record all completed operations and compensation events
- **Business logic**: Handle different transaction types (orders, refunds, exchanges)

Key concepts:

- **Saga pattern**: Coordinate distributed transactions across multiple services
- **Compensation events**: Publish events for each rollback action
- **Idempotency**: Ensure compensation actions can be safely repeated
- **Audit trail**: Maintain complete history of operations and compensations

## Error Handling Best Practices

- **Use appropriate data types**: Choose `json` for flexible error objects, specific types for performance
- **Test error scenarios**: Explicitly test error handling code with simulated failures
- **Limit retry attempts**: Prevent resource exhaustion with maximum retry counts
- **Use timeouts**: Add timeouts to external service calls to prevent blocking
- **Monitor memory usage**: Error handling can increase memory usage with additional data
- **Clean up error topics**: Implement retention policies for error and retry topics

## Error Handling Patterns Summary

| Pattern | Use Case | Benefits | Trade-offs |
|:--------|:---------|:---------|:-----------|
| **Validation & Filtering** | Data quality issues | Early error detection, clear routing | Additional processing overhead |
| **Try-Catch** | Function-level errors | Graceful degradation, detailed context | Code complexity, performance impact |
| **Dead Letter Queue** | Permanent failures | No data loss, failure analysis | Additional topics, storage overhead |
| **Circuit Breaker** | External service failures | Prevents cascading failures | Added complexity, state management |
