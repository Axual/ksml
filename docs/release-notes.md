### 1.0.3 (2024-10-18)
* KSML
  * Fix high CPU usage
  * Upgrade to Avro 1.11.4 to fix CVE-2024-47561

### 1.0.2 (2024-09-20)
* KSML
  * Upgrade to Kafka Streams 3.8.0
  * Avro Schema Registry settings no longer required if Avro not used 
  * Add missing object in KSML Json Schema
  * Fix serialisation and list handling issues
* Helm charts
  * Use liveness and readiness and startup probes to fix state issues
  * Fix conflicting default configuration Prometheus export and ServiceMonitor

### 1.0.1 (2024-07-17)
* Topology Optimization can be applied
* Runtime dependencies, like LZ4 compression support, are back in the KSML image
* Fix parse error messages during join
* Fix windowed aggregation flow errors
* Update windowed object support in multiple operations and functions

### 1.0.0 (2024-06-28)

* Reworked parsing logic, allowing alternatives for operations and other definitions to co-exist in the KSML language
  specification. This allows for better syntax checking in IDEs.
* Lots of small fixes and completion modifications.

### 0.9.1 (2024-06-21)

* Fix failing test in GitHub Actions during release
* Unified build workflows

### 0.9.0 (2024-06-05)

* Collectable metrics
* New topology test suite
* Python context hardening
* Improved handling of Kafka tombstones
* Added flexibility to producers (single shot, n-shot, or user condition-based)
* JSON Logging support
* Bumped GraalVM to 23.1.2
* Bumped several dependency versions
* Several fixes and security updates

### 0.8.0 (2024-03-08)

* Reworked all parsing logic, to allow for exporting the JSON schema of the KSML specification:
    * docs/specification.md is now derived from internal parser logic, guaranteeing consistency and completeness.
    * examples/ksml.json contains the JSON schema, which can be loaded into IDEs for syntax validation and completion.
* Improved schema handling:
    * Better compatibility checking between schema fields.
* Improved support for state stores:
    * Update to state store typing and handling.
    * Manual state stores can be defined and referenced in pipelines.
    * Manual state stores are also available in Python functions.
    * State stores can be used 'side-effect-free' (e.g. no AVRO schema registration)
* Python function improvements:
    * Automatic variable assignment for state stores.
    * Every Python function can use a Java Logger, integrating Python output with KSML log output.
    * Type inference in situations where parameters or result types can be derived from the context.
* Lots of small language updates:
    * Improve readability for store types, filter operations and windowing operations
    * Introduction of the "as" operation, which allows for pipeline referencing and chaining.
* Better data type handling:
    * Separation of data types and KSML core, allowing for easier addition of new data types in the future.
    * Automatic conversion of data types, removing common pipeline failure scenarios.
    * New implementation for CSV handling.
* Merged the different runners into a single runner.
    * KSML definitions can now include both producers (data generators) and pipelines (Kafka Streams topologies).
    * Removal of Kafka and Axual backend distinctions.
* Configuration file updates, allowing for running multiple definitions in a single runner (each in its own namespace).
* Examples updated to reflect the latest definition format.
* Documentation updated.
