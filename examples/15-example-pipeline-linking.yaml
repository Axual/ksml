# This example shows how to read from four simple streams and log all messages

streams:
  sensor_source_avro:
    topic: ksml_sensordata_avro
    keyType: string
    valueType: avro:SensorData

functions:
  # Log the message using the built-in log variable that is passed in from Java
  log_message:
    type: forEach
    parameters:
      - name: pipeline
        type: string
    code: log.info("Consumed {} message - key={}, value={}", pipeline, key, value)

pipelines:
  # Every pipeline logs its own message and then ends by naming the pipeline for further processing using the "as"
  # operation to terminate the pipeline
  first:
    # Use stream defined above as input
    from: sensor_source_avro
    via:
      - type: peek
        forEach:
          code: log_message(key, value, pipeline="FIRST")
    as: first_pipeline_result

  second:
    # Use the result from the first pipeline as input
    from: first_pipeline_result
    via:
      - type: peek
        forEach:
          code: log_message(key, value, pipeline="SECOND")
    as: second_pipeline_result

  third:
    # Use the result from the second pipeline as input
    from: second_pipeline_result
    via:
      - type: peek
        forEach:
          code: log_message(key, value, pipeline="THIRD")
    as: third_pipeline_result

  fourth:
    # Use the result from the third pipeline as input
    from: third_pipeline_result
    via:
      - type: peek
        forEach:
          code: log_message(key, value, pipeline="FOURTH")
    as: fourth_pipeline_result

  last:
    # Use the result from the fourth pipeline as input
    from: fourth_pipeline_result
    forEach:
      code: log_message(key, value, pipeline="LAST")
