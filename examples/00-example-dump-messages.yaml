# This example shows how to read from a binary stream, manipulate specific bytes and output
# messages on a target stream. For validation purposes a second pipeline outputs the manipulated
# results.

# Concrete use case for this manipulation can be the manual override of a schema id, when the source
# message contains a schema id that is not locally recognized. By changing bytes 1-4 in the value,
# one can override the schema id for further downstream processing.

# Yes, this is hacky, but it may serve a purpose for cases where binary message copies are made from
# remote Kafka clusters with their own (possibly conflicting) schema ids.
